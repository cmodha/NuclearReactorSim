# Nuclear Reactor Sim
Scripts which simulated multiple aspects of Uranium nuclear reactors, such as neutron random walks, interaction cross sections, Uranium 235 critical mass and much more. This was completed as part of my second year in university. All code was written in collaboration with Dan Hargreaves.
